MARKET_STORIES = {
    "Market A: The Boom": "Consumer spending is at an all-time high and credit is nearly free. In this 'Goldilocks' economy, almost any well-run business can find a customer. The primary risk is over-expansion rather than insolvency.",
    "Market B: The Squeeze": "Inflation is rampant and store shelves are empty. This 'Stagflation' environment is punishing for companies with high overhead. Only the most efficient business models can survive the rising cost of capital.",
    "Market C: Rule Change": "The regulatory landscape has shifted. New government mandates have created massive tailwinds for specific green energy sectors while suddenly bankrupting traditional industrial players."
}

TYPE_STORY = {
    "Type 1: The Basics": "This fund focuses on 'Utility' plays: infrastructure, water, and power. These businesses are boring but essential, providing steady cash flows even during economic downturns.",
    "Type 2: Tech Apps": "This fund focuses on scalable platforms like social media and delivery. Competition is fierce, but the ability to grow at zero marginal cost offers significant upside if the company survives the initial burn.",
    "Type 3: Big Science": "This fund focuses on frontier technology: rocket engines, deep-sea mining, and experimental AI. These ventures face massive 'R&D' risk, but a single success can redefine an entire industry."
